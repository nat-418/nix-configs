# Nix configurations üå®Ô∏è

This repository contains to directories: `nixos` for [NixOS]-specific files,
and `home-manager` for [Home Manager]-specific files.

Some files are examples, like `./home-manager/home.nix`, and not real
configurations; these files typically contain sensitive or secret data that
should not be publicly shared. They exist here as simplified examples to give
the reader a sense of how to go about setting up their own files for
themselves.

**Note:** these files assume the latest stable NixOS version, currently 23.11,
and the corresponding Nixpkgs and Home Manager versions.
